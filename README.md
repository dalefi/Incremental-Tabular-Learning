master thesis project on learning new classes in a gradient boosted ensemble tree model (XGBoost)

Installation:

Create a virtual environment and run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
Then to manually install the custom modules run 'pip install -e mylib'

In mylib/mylib/pipelines lies a file 'experiments.py'. It can be copied in a directory of choice and run there with any
dataset that fulfills the requirements that are described in 'experiments.py'. Information on the parameters that need to
be passed to 'experiments.py' are also found in the same file.
